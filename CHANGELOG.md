# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* **Save format 2.0.0.** Coordinates are canonical centimetres throughout and
  the file carries `"units": "cm"` saying so. 0.0.2a wrote corner coordinates
  in whatever display unit was active at save time while control points and
  item positions went out raw, so one file mixed two units and recorded
  neither — the same plan saved under metres and centimetres differed by 100×,
  and reading a metre-era file as centimetres collapsed it to a single point.
  All twenty-five save/load unit combinations now round-trip exactly, and the
  rounding drift goes with the conversion.
* **`material_colors` is sparse**, holding a colour only for a material slot
  somebody actually recoloured and `null` for the rest — absent entirely when
  nothing was. It used to hold every material's colour on every save, which
  froze a model's own appearance into every design using it.
* **`Version.isVersionHigherThan` does what its name says** — a breaking change
  to a public API. It compared its arguments backwards, returned `1`/`0`/`false`
  from one function, and threw on a hand-edited file. `Version.compare` and
  `Version.isVersionAtLeast` are new.

### Fixed

* **The save format can be versioned at all.** `loadFloorplan` gated curved-wall
  control points on the broken comparator, so stamping a file anything newer
  than `0.0.2a` silently turned every curved wall straight and discarded its
  control points. The gate now reads the wall record.
* Saving an item with an empty material array threw a `TypeError`.

### Compatibility

Files written before 2.0.0 load unchanged, under the same rule they were
written under: no `units` field means coordinates are in the current display
unit. Open one under the unit it was written in and save it, and it is
upgraded — there is no separate migration step. Their `material_colors` are
applied and written straight back, so nothing anyone chose is discarded.

The pre-colour-management darkening is still not re-interpreted, and
deliberately: nothing in an old file distinguishes a colour the model author
baked in from one the user picked, so converting them wholesale would correct
the first and corrupt the second. Re-picking the colour once produces a file
that says exactly what was meant.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-13

The migration release. Ten sprints (S0–S9) moved the project from rollup +
Babel + jQuery + three r98 onto Vite + Vue 3 + three 0.185, with feature parity
frozen throughout: every sprint ended with the application fully working, and
every deliberate visual change was reviewed against a screenshot grid before it
landed. The plan, and what each sprint actually delivered, is in
[the migration roadmap](https://amitukind.github.io/architect3d/docs/roadmap.html).

### Added

* **A test suite.** 813 headless tests in 15 files, from none. Mostly
  characterization: written against the pre-migration behaviour and pinning it,
  quirks included, so the rewrites underneath could be proved not to change it
  (S0, extended every sprint since).
* **A Vue 3 application** replacing the jQuery demo — the shell, both
  viewports, the toolbars, the catalog, and native inspector panels for
  corners, walls, rooms, surfaces, items and the carbon sheet (S6, S7).
* **A documentation site** at `/docs/`: getting started, architecture, the save
  file format field by field, and the event reference (S9).
* **Continuous integration and deployment.** Tests, lint and the library build
  on every push to `dev` and `master`; `master` also builds and publishes the
  application and docs to GitHub Pages (S1, S9).
* **`dispose()`** on `BlueprintJS`, the 3D view and the 2D floorplanner —
  mount, unmount and remount now leak no listeners and no WebGL context (S2).
* **A rendering-parity harness** (`npm run parity`): eleven states rendered
  through r98 and r185 side by side, from the frozen `legacy-demo` tag (S5),
  with a third column for the colour change (S8).

### Changed

* **three r98 → 0.185.1.** Every hand-built mesh rewritten from the removed
  `Geometry` class to `BufferGeometry`, the merge pipeline rewritten from
  per-face material indices to material groups, and the vendored orbit and
  pointer-lock controls replaced by three's own addons (S4, S5).
* **rollup 1 + Babel 6 → Vite 8.** No Babel: the source was already ES2015+
  modules (S1).
* **The 25 legacy three.js JSON models → glTF**, converted offline and verified
  per model against measurements taken under r98 — triangle count, bounds,
  surface area, position and UV digests. Designs saved with the old URLs still
  load; the library rewrites them (S3).
* **Colour management is on.** Textures are tagged sRGB and the frame is
  encoded to match, deliberately and as a reviewed change rather than a side
  effect of the engine bump (S8).
* **The renderer honours the display pixel ratio** (S8).
* **Assets moved from `build/` to `public/`**, and the `<base href="/build/">`
  that used to redirect every runtime URL is gone (S9).
* **`package.json` `main`** points at the ESM barrel `src/scripts/blueprint.js`
  rather than a prebuilt bundle, with `exports` and `files` to match (S9).

### Fixed

* **The shadow camera never updated its projection.** The call sat inside a
  branch guarding on a property three removed around r73, so shadows were sized
  for whatever plan existed when the camera was born (S5).
* **A leaked keyboard listener.** `OrbitControls` resolves the document through
  `domElement.getRootNode()`; if the host detached first, the removal landed on
  an orphaned subtree and the listener stayed alive (S6).
* **The floorplanner mode event** carried its mode in a field the application
  was not reading (S6).
* **Loading a design with a carbon sheet** threw in widget mode, where there is
  no 2D view to own one (S0).
* **glTF export failures were silent** — the old exporter had no error channel
  at all, so a caller waited on an event that never fired (S4).

### Removed

* **jQuery, Bootstrap 3, dat.GUI, QuickSettings, jquery.flip, jquery-ui.css and
  the glyphicon webfont.** The application's stylesheet is its own and the
  icons are inline SVG. Runtime dependencies are now Vue, three and bezier-js,
  and nothing else (S6, S7).
* **The vendored copies of jQuery 1.11.3 / 2.1.4 and Bootstrap 3.3.5** that
  shipped to every user. Checked-in files, so Dependabot could not see them
  (S9).
* **esdoc and its 82 MB of committed output.** Abandoned upstream in 2018, and
  the origin of all 20 of this project's npm advisories — 5 critical, 11 high.
  Replaced by the documentation site (S9).
* **`build/`, `resources/`, `build/vrtest`, the orphaned model directories, and
  eight dead root files.** Tracked files fell from 228 MB to 63 MB (S9).
* **A debug `AxesHelper`** that drew three coloured lines out of the origin of
  every design, for every user, behind no flag (S5).
* **Dead properties** that had been inert for the life of the file:
  `shadowDarkness`, `shadowCameraVisible` and friends, all removed from three
  well before r98 (S5).

### Known and deliberate

* **Coordinates in a save file are written in the user's display unit**, the
  version field cannot be bumped, and pre-S8 designs store linear colour values
  in a field that now reads as sRGB. All three are addressed in Unreleased
  above; they were the state at 1.0.0.
* **Two bugs in `Utils.pointInPolygon` and `isClockwise`** are asserted as they
  are, because room detection depends on them.
* **Textures are reloaded per wall per redraw and never disposed.**
* **`npm audit` reports 3 dev-only advisories** through VitePress, which pins
  an older Vite and esbuild. They affect the docs dev server, not the built
  site and not the application. They clear when VitePress 2 leaves alpha.

## [1.0.0-pre] - 2020-06-20

* Various room type objects such as wall items, floor items, ceiling items,
  wall-floor items etc.
* Naming the rooms
* Switching between various metrics of measurement
