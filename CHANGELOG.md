# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* **Type checking, over the JSDoc that was already there.** `npm run typecheck`
  runs `vue-tsc`, which checks the annotations and the single-file-component
  templates against their own script blocks. No `.ts` files, no source rewrite —
  a file opts in with `// @ts-check` on its first line. Forty are in: all of
  `core/`, all sixteen composables, the public entry point, and the eleven
  components that were already clean. TypeScript 6, not 7: 7.0 ships no stable
  programmatic API until 7.1, so `vue-tsc` cannot run on it.

  It found real defects on the first pass, each fixed here — a `@param` whose
  name was swallowed by a stray hyphen, so five documented options described
  nothing; `Main.controller` annotated as permanently `null` because `init()`
  assigns it through an alias, which made `getController()` useless to every
  caller; `threeCanvasElement` documented as `string` while the app passes
  `null`; an undeclared static on `Utils`; and two JSDoc types naming three
  classes the module never imported.
* **A pre-commit hook** (`simple-git-hooks` + `lint-staged`), installed by
  `npm install`. It lints the staged files, type-checks the project, and runs
  the suites that import them.
  This is the cheapest gate in the project and the one that matters most: CI
  deliberately does not run on working branches, so until now *nothing at all*
  ran before a merge. It costs no Actions minutes.
* **Coverage measurement, with a floor.** `npm run test:coverage`, thresholds in
  `vitest.config.mjs`, enforced in CI. The first measurement — lines 74.91%,
  statements 75.07%, branches 61.51%, functions 73.05% — became the floor,
  rounded down. 870 tests existed before this and nobody knew what they reached.
  The thresholds are a ratchet: raise them when a change earns it, never lower
  them to make a build pass.
* **Size budgets** for the built output — `npm run budget`, limits committed in
  `tools/budget.json`, enforced in CI and again in the deploy job before the
  docs are folded into the deployed tree. Gzip for the text bundles, raw bytes
  for the asset trees. The demo bundle reached 1.1 MB and the deployed tree
  21.6 MB without anybody deciding either number; a budget does not make them
  smaller, it makes growth something someone chooses.

* **Undo and redo**, over every edit — walls, corners, rooms, furniture,
  textures, inspector fields. Entries are snapshots of the serialized design
  rather than an inverse-command stack, because the library's mutations are not
  individually invertible: `Corner.mergeWithIntersected` can delete a corner,
  move another and rebuild the room set in one call. A snapshot cannot be
  subtly wrong. Continuous gestures coalesce into one entry, and the stack is
  capped at 50.
* **A split workspace.** Plan, 3D, or both side by side with a draggable
  divider, replacing the two-faced card flip — a card has exactly two faces, so
  there was no arrangement in which both views were visible at once.
* **Keyboard shortcuts**, in one map, with a reference sheet built from that
  same map so it cannot drift. Suppressed while a text field has focus.
* **Light and dark themes**, reaching the drawing canvas as well as the chrome.
* **Autosave.** The working design is kept in local storage and *offered* back
  after a reload, rather than restored silently — someone who closed a design
  to start fresh should not get it back without being asked.
* **Zoom, framing and grid controls for the plan.** Wheel zoom, a stop table,
  zoom-to-fit, recentre, snap toggle and grid density. Zoom was a dat.GUI
  slider from 0.5 to 1.5 in the demo and nothing at all after S7.
* **Delete and duplicate for the selected item.** Removing one previously meant
  finding the small red cross the HUD draws over a hovered item; there was no
  way to duplicate anything.
* **A status bar**: room, wall and item counts, total floor area, the pointer's
  plan coordinates, the zoom level, and what the active tool expects next.
* **`EVENT_ITEM_MOVE_FINISH`**, dispatched on the scene when a drag or rotation
  settles. Nothing previously marked the *end* of a direct manipulation.
* **`floorplannerPalette` / `setFloorplannerPalette`**, making every colour the
  2D canvas draws with themable. The twenty-one exported colour constants are
  unchanged and are now the palette's defaults, so an embedder that themes
  nothing gets pixel-identical output.
* **`three/render_profile.js`**, and a `studio` render profile: physically
  based walls and floors, an image-based environment from `RoomEnvironment`,
  ACES filmic tone mapping, a 2048 shadow map on an off-axis key light, and
  linear fog to the horizon. `classic` — exactly what shipped through 1.0.0 —
  remains the library default and is switchable at runtime through
  `Main.applyRenderProfile()`.
* **`Lights.dispose()`.**

### Changed

* **CI builds all three outputs, not one.** The application and the
  documentation builds previously ran only in the deploy job, on `master`, so a
  broken Vue template or an unresolvable Tailwind token reached `master` before
  anything noticed. Adding both costs about twenty seconds. The branch policy is
  unchanged: `dev` and `master` only, never a working branch.
* The deploy job runs the suite **with coverage thresholds**, matching CI — if
  it is going to re-run the tests rather than trust CI, it should run the same
  tests.
* **The interface was rebuilt.** A top bar, a tool rail, a docked inspector and
  a status bar around a workspace, built with Tailwind CSS 4, Reka UI, lucide
  and VueUse — all four devDependencies, because `files` publishes `src/scripts`
  alone and nothing a consumer installs could import them. The two per-viewport
  toolbars are gone: they carried the same five file actions twice, which stops
  being invisible once both viewports can be on screen at once.
* **The furniture catalog is a drawer, not a modal.** It no longer covers the
  room being furnished, no longer closes on every pick, and searches all 168
  models rather than offering eight accordion sections one at a time.
* **The 2D grid has two weights**, a heavier line every fourth cell, keyed off
  the plan origin so the heavy lines do not crawl while panning.
* **Loading a design frames it.** New, open and draft-restore zoom to fit,
  capped at 200% so there is still somewhere to draw.
* **Save format 2.0.0.** Coordinates are canonical centimetres throughout and
  the file carries `"units": "cm"` saying so. 0.0.2a wrote corner coordinates
  in whatever display unit was active at save time while control points and
  item positions went out raw, so one file mixed two units and recorded
  neither — the same plan saved under metres and centimetres differed by 100×,
  and reading a metre-era file as centimetres collapsed it to a single point.
  All twenty-five save/load unit combinations now round-trip exactly, and the
  rounding drift goes with the conversion.
* **`material_colors` is sparse**, holding a colour only for a material slot
  somebody actually recoloured and `null` for the rest — absent entirely when
  nothing was. It used to hold every material's colour on every save, which
  froze a model's own appearance into every design using it.
* **`Version.isVersionHigherThan` does what its name says** — a breaking change
  to a public API. It compared its arguments backwards, returned `1`/`0`/`false`
  from one function, and threw on a hand-edited file. `Version.compare` and
  `Version.isVersionAtLeast` are new.

### Fixed

* **`Main.getController()` was typed as always returning `null`**, because
  `init()` assigns the property through a `scope` alias rather than through
  `this`, so nothing ever declared it. Annotated — no runtime change, but every
  consumer of that method now gets a real type instead of a useless one.
* **`BlueprintJS`'s constructor documented five options that did not exist.**
  `@param {Object} - options` — the stray hyphen made the parameter name empty,
  so `options.floorplannerElement` and its four siblings were attached to
  nothing, and generated types omitted all five.
* **The 2D plan no longer slides off the edge when its pane is resized.** The
  pan origin is the plan coordinate at the canvas' top-left corner, so a resize
  that left it alone pinned the drawing to that corner. Tolerable when only the
  window resized; not once there is a divider to drag.
* **`Lights` leaked a floorplan listener on every construction.** `init()`
  subscribed to `EVENT_UPDATED` and nothing ever unsubscribed, so a
  mount/unmount cycle left one behind — possible since S2 gave the viewer a
  `dispose()`.
* **The 3D key light emits light.** `lights.js` constructed a white
  `DirectionalLight` and then called `setHSL(1, 1, 0.1)` on it; hue 1 wraps to
  0, so the "white" key has always been `#330000`. Fixed under `studio` only —
  `classic` keeps it, because the parity grid is calibrated against it.
* **The save format can be versioned at all.** `loadFloorplan` gated curved-wall
  control points on the broken comparator, so stamping a file anything newer
  than `0.0.2a` silently turned every curved wall straight and discarded its
  control points. The gate now reads the wall record.
* Saving an item with an empty material array threw a `TypeError`.

### Removed

* **`core/log.js` and its five exports** (`log`, `isLogging`, `logContext`,
  `ELogContext`, `ELogLevel`). A complete logging subsystem that nothing ever
  called, and that could not be switched on — `logContext` was initialised to
  `None` with no setter. The library's export surface goes from 137 to 132.
* **The `isgltf` construction path in `Item`**, and the parameter it was
  threaded through in all eight item subclasses. It predated the S3 merge
  pipeline and had been unreachable since: `Scene`'s loader callback declares
  `(geometry, materials)` and both call sites pass the merged pair. If anything
  had reached it, it left `this.material` as an invisible wireframe box's
  material — which `setMaterialColor` would then have painted.
* **Ten orphaned assets from `public/`**, including two environment maps and
  three thumbnails for the env-map picker that does not exist yet, and a
  texture orphaned when the ground reflector was dropped in S4.
* **565 files from `asset-pipeline/`** — 284 byte-identical duplicates of files
  already in `public/`, and 280 `.obj`/`.mtl` files holding the same 140 models
  in a second format that nothing reads.
* **252 lines of commented-out code** across 21 source files.

Tracked files fall from 59.9 MB across 1297 files to 51.9 MB across 721.

The test suite goes from 828 tests in 16 files to 870 in 17.

### Compatibility

Files written before 2.0.0 load unchanged, under the same rule they were
written under: no `units` field means coordinates are in the current display
unit. Open one under the unit it was written in and save it, and it is
upgraded — there is no separate migration step. Their `material_colors` are
applied and written straight back, so nothing anyone chose is discarded.

The pre-colour-management darkening is still not re-interpreted, and
deliberately: nothing in an old file distinguishes a colour the model author
baked in from one the user picked, so converting them wholesale would correct
the first and corrupt the second. Re-picking the colour once produces a file
that says exactly what was meant.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-13

The migration release. Ten sprints (S0–S9) moved the project from rollup +
Babel + jQuery + three r98 onto Vite + Vue 3 + three 0.185, with feature parity
frozen throughout: every sprint ended with the application fully working, and
every deliberate visual change was reviewed against a screenshot grid before it
landed. The plan, and what each sprint actually delivered, is in
[the migration roadmap](https://amitukind.github.io/architect3d/docs/roadmap.html).

### Added

* **A test suite.** 813 headless tests in 15 files, from none. Mostly
  characterization: written against the pre-migration behaviour and pinning it,
  quirks included, so the rewrites underneath could be proved not to change it
  (S0, extended every sprint since).
* **A Vue 3 application** replacing the jQuery demo — the shell, both
  viewports, the toolbars, the catalog, and native inspector panels for
  corners, walls, rooms, surfaces, items and the carbon sheet (S6, S7).
* **A documentation site** at `/docs/`: getting started, architecture, the save
  file format field by field, and the event reference (S9).
* **Continuous integration and deployment.** Tests, lint and the library build
  on every push to `dev` and `master`; `master` also builds and publishes the
  application and docs to GitHub Pages (S1, S9).
* **`dispose()`** on `BlueprintJS`, the 3D view and the 2D floorplanner —
  mount, unmount and remount now leak no listeners and no WebGL context (S2).
* **A rendering-parity harness** (`npm run parity`): eleven states rendered
  through r98 and r185 side by side, from the frozen `legacy-demo` tag (S5),
  with a third column for the colour change (S8).

### Changed

* **three r98 → 0.185.1.** Every hand-built mesh rewritten from the removed
  `Geometry` class to `BufferGeometry`, the merge pipeline rewritten from
  per-face material indices to material groups, and the vendored orbit and
  pointer-lock controls replaced by three's own addons (S4, S5).
* **rollup 1 + Babel 6 → Vite 8.** No Babel: the source was already ES2015+
  modules (S1).
* **The 25 legacy three.js JSON models → glTF**, converted offline and verified
  per model against measurements taken under r98 — triangle count, bounds,
  surface area, position and UV digests. Designs saved with the old URLs still
  load; the library rewrites them (S3).
* **Colour management is on.** Textures are tagged sRGB and the frame is
  encoded to match, deliberately and as a reviewed change rather than a side
  effect of the engine bump (S8).
* **The renderer honours the display pixel ratio** (S8).
* **Assets moved from `build/` to `public/`**, and the `<base href="/build/">`
  that used to redirect every runtime URL is gone (S9).
* **`package.json` `main`** points at the ESM barrel `src/scripts/blueprint.js`
  rather than a prebuilt bundle, with `exports` and `files` to match (S9).

### Fixed

* **The shadow camera never updated its projection.** The call sat inside a
  branch guarding on a property three removed around r73, so shadows were sized
  for whatever plan existed when the camera was born (S5).
* **A leaked keyboard listener.** `OrbitControls` resolves the document through
  `domElement.getRootNode()`; if the host detached first, the removal landed on
  an orphaned subtree and the listener stayed alive (S6).
* **The floorplanner mode event** carried its mode in a field the application
  was not reading (S6).
* **Loading a design with a carbon sheet** threw in widget mode, where there is
  no 2D view to own one (S0).
* **glTF export failures were silent** — the old exporter had no error channel
  at all, so a caller waited on an event that never fired (S4).

### Removed

* **jQuery, Bootstrap 3, dat.GUI, QuickSettings, jquery.flip, jquery-ui.css and
  the glyphicon webfont.** The application's stylesheet is its own and the
  icons are inline SVG. Runtime dependencies are now Vue, three and bezier-js,
  and nothing else (S6, S7).
* **The vendored copies of jQuery 1.11.3 / 2.1.4 and Bootstrap 3.3.5** that
  shipped to every user. Checked-in files, so Dependabot could not see them
  (S9).
* **esdoc and its 82 MB of committed output.** Abandoned upstream in 2018, and
  the origin of all 20 of this project's npm advisories — 5 critical, 11 high.
  Replaced by the documentation site (S9).
* **`build/`, `resources/`, `build/vrtest`, the orphaned model directories, and
  eight dead root files.** Tracked files fell from 228 MB to 63 MB (S9).
* **A debug `AxesHelper`** that drew three coloured lines out of the origin of
  every design, for every user, behind no flag (S5).
* **Dead properties** that had been inert for the life of the file:
  `shadowDarkness`, `shadowCameraVisible` and friends, all removed from three
  well before r98 (S5).

### Known and deliberate

* **Coordinates in a save file are written in the user's display unit**, the
  version field cannot be bumped, and pre-S8 designs store linear colour values
  in a field that now reads as sRGB. All three are addressed in Unreleased
  above; they were the state at 1.0.0.
* **Two bugs in `Utils.pointInPolygon` and `isClockwise`** are asserted as they
  are, because room detection depends on them.
* **Textures are reloaded per wall per redraw and never disposed.**
* **`npm audit` reports 3 dev-only advisories** through VitePress, which pins
  an older Vite and esbuild. They affect the docs dev server, not the built
  site and not the application. They clear when VitePress 2 leaves alpha.
